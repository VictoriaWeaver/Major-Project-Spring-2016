This project is an implementation of a few instructions of MIPS in VHDL.  The instructions are the R-type (register type) instructions as well as load word and store word.

The project is compiled/synthesized using the Xilinx ISE Design Suite.  Screen Captures of the RTL are included.*

*Optimization from the Xilinx tools cause some portions of the design to be trimmed, or replaced with ground due the to initializations of memory to all zero vectors.
